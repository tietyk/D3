Our map has become interactive in the previous post, by adding the zoom functionality. Lets add some explanatory content now, every map should have labels and a legend, right. We will begin with adding labels to each of the provinces on the map. The final result of this post is found in my [demo](http://tietyk.github.io/D3/Prototype/part6-9.html) on [Github](http://tietyk.github.io/D3/).

We will use text elements to add the labels to the map. Adding the text elements to the SVG follows the same pattern as we saw before. [Select](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Selections#d3_selectAll) the elements you want to add inside the SVG, add the [data](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Selections#data), [connect](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Selections#enter) the data and the elements and finally [append](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Selections#append) them to the map. Inside the GeoJSON file is information about the paths we have drawn, like the name of the province and a unique id. We'll use this properties to add the name tot the text element with [.text()](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Selections#text) method. To the center the name inside the shape on the screen we'll use the [.centroid()](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Geo-Paths#path_centroid) method.

<pre lang='js'>
var label = svg.selectAll("text")
    .data(geo_data.features)
    .enter()
    .append("text")
      .attr("class", "label")
      .attr("transform", function(d) { return "translate(" + path.centroid(d) + ")"; })
      .text(function(d) { return d.properties.OMSCHRIJVI;} );
</pre>

The labels are on the map now and stay in the correct position when you zoom, but they also zoom along and grow bigger when you zoom in, which makes them rather big eventually. I would like the font-size to stay a constant size on the screen for all the zoom levels. To do that we can divide the font-size through the scale factor and add it with a new [.style()](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Selections#style) method to the SVG element within the *zoomhandler* event handler.

<pre lang='js' mark="3">
function zoomhandler() {
  svg.attr("transform", "translate(" + d3.event.translate + ")scale(" + d3.event.scale + ")")
    .style("font-size", function(){return 12 / (d3.event.scale) + "px";});
}
</pre>

Finally some styling enhancements to the labels. The *text-anchor: middle;* works in SVG a lot like *text-align: center;* would in normal CSS. With this addition the labels are now exactly centred in the provinces.

<pre lang='css'>
.label {
  font-weight: bold;
  text-anchor: middle;
  cursor: default;
}
</pre>

**The first layer of explanatory information is now present in the map. In the next post we'll add a legend to the map to explain the meaning of the colors on the map.**
